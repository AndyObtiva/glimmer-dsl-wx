# TODO

- Wx symbol constants (e.g. :grow means Wx::GROW and [:grow, :all] means (Wx::GROW | Wx::ALL ))
- Glimmer::Wx module that behaves just like ::Wx for convenience (so that if a developer includes Glimmer, they can still say Wx::SOMETHING without adding :: prefix)
- General Control Property Data-Binding support
