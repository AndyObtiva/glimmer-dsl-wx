# TODO

- Move `glimmer_new` samples to `hello` directory
- Sizer addable support (e.g. supporting `add_growable_col(1, 1)`)
- Wx symbol constants (e.g. :grow means Wx::GROW and [:grow, :all] means (Wx::GROW | Wx::ALL ))
- Glimmer::Wx module that behaves just like ::Wx for convenience (so that if a developer includes Glimmer, they can still say Wx::SOMETHING without adding :: prefix)
- MessageDialog
- General Control Property Data-Binding support
