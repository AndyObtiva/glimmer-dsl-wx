# TODO

- Wx symbol constants (e.g. :grow means Wx::GROW and [:grow, :all] means (Wx::GROW | Wx::ALL ))
- Consider supporting `on_evt_EVENTNAME` and `on_event_EVENTNAME` alternate syntaxes for `on_EVENTNAME` listeners in case some software engineers find them clearer (following the Ruby More Than One Way approach)
- General Control Property Data-Binding support
